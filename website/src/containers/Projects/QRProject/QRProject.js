                This project was developed for CMPUT 301 at the University of Alberta, focusing on the creation of an Android application that turns QR code scanning into a competitive game. Much like Pok√©mon Go, players hunt for QR codes to earn points. Upon scanning a QR code, the location is revealed on a map, and a name and score are automatically generated based on the QR code's hash.

                Players can interact by adding friends, commenting on profiles and individual QR codes, and engaging in competition through a leaderboard feature. The leaderboard showcases the top QR codes and player profiles, with filters to view standings among friends or on a global scale. Users can also view QR codes on the map, allowing them to strategically hunt them down and collect scores. The game's engaging features provide a unique twist on QR code interaction, turning it into a social and strategic experience.
